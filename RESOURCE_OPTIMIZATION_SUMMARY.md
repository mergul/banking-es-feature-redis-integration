# Resource Consumption Optimization Summary

## Problem Analysis

The high-throughput CDC test was experiencing resource consumption issues that caused restarts due to:

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Too many concurrent connections (500 max, 100 min)
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large cache sizes (10,000 entries) and batch sizes (10,000)
3. **Worker Overload**: 25 workers with 5,000 operations each
4. **Insufficient Timeouts**: Short timeouts causing cascading failures
5. **No Circuit Breakers**: No protection against resource exhaustion

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Database Pool Optimization

**Before:**

```rust
.max_connections(500)
.min_connections(100)
.acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
```

**After:**

```rust
.max_connections(100)  // Reduced by 80%
.min_connections(20)   // Reduced by 80%
.acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
.test_before_acquire(true) // Added connection testing
```

### 2. Test Parameters Reduction

**Before:**

```rust
let target_ops = 5000;
let worker_count = 25;
let account_count = 500;
let channel_buffer_size = 5000;
```

**After:**

```rust
let target_ops = 1000;        // Reduced by 80%
let worker_count = 10;        // Reduced by 60%
let account_count = 100;      // Reduced by 80%
let channel_buffer_size = 1000; // Reduced by 80%
```

### 3. Cache Configuration Optimization

**Before:**

```rust
cache_config.default_ttl = Duration::from_secs(1800);
cache_config.max_size = 10000;
cache_config.shard_count = 64;
cache_config.warmup_batch_size = 100;
```

**After:**

```rust
cache_config.default_ttl = Duration::from_secs(300);   // Reduced by 83%
cache_config.max_size = 1000;                          // Reduced by 90%
cache_config.shard_count = 16;                         // Reduced by 75%
cache_config.warmup_batch_size = 50;                   // Reduced by 50%
```

### 4. Event Store Configuration

**Before:**

```rust
max_connections: 200,
min_connections: 50,
batch_size: 10000,
batch_processor_count: 32,
```

**After:**

```rust
max_connections: 50,           // Reduced by 75%
min_connections: 10,           // Reduced by 80%
batch_size: 1000,              // Reduced by 90%
batch_processor_count: 8,      // Reduced by 75%
```

### 5. Projection Store Configuration

**Before:**

```rust
max_connections: 100,
min_connections: 20,
batch_size: 5000,
```

**After:**

```rust
max_connections: 30,           // Reduced by 70%
min_connections: 5,            // Reduced by 75%
batch_size: 1000,              // Reduced by 80%
```

### 6. Circuit Breakers and Resource Monitoring

Added comprehensive circuit breakers:

```rust
// Pool utilization monitoring
if utilization > 0.8 {
    tracing::warn!("⚠️ High pool utilization detected: {:.1}%, pausing operations", utilization * 100.0);
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
}

// Worker failure circuit breaker
if consecutive_failures >= max_consecutive_failures {
    tracing::warn!("⚠️ Too many consecutive failures, pausing for 5 seconds");
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
    consecutive_failures = 0;
}
```

### 7. Semaphore and Timeout Management

**Before:**

```rust
let db_semaphore = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Semaphore::new(50));
let _permit = db_semaphore.acquire().await.unwrap();
```

**After:**

```rust
let db_semaphore = Arc::new(tokio::sync::Semaphore::new(20)); // Reduced by 60%

// With timeout and error handling
let permit_result = tokio::time::timeout(
    Duration::from_secs(5),
    db_semaphore.acquire()
).await;

let _permit = match permit_result {
    Ok(Ok(permit)) => permit,
    Ok(Err(e)) => {
        tracing::error!("Failed to acquire semaphore permit: {}", e);
        consecutive_failures += 1;
        continue;
    }
    Err(_) => {
        tracing::warn!("Semaphore acquisition timeout");
        consecutive_failures += 1;
        continue;
    }
};
```

### 8. Resource Cleanup

Added proper resource cleanup:

```rust
async fn cleanup_test_resources(context: &RealCDCTestContext) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    // Stop CDC service manager
    context.cdc_service_manager.stop().await?;

    // Wait for services to fully stop
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;

    // Log final pool state
    tracing::info!("Final DB pool state - size: {}, idle: {}",
                   context.db_pool.size(), context.db_pool.num_idle());

    Ok(())
}
```

### 9. Environment Configuration

Created `run_optimized_test.sh` with conservative environment variables:

```bash
export DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=100
export DB_MIN_CONNECTIONS=20
export REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS=50
export DB_BATCH_SIZE=1000
```

## Expected Results

These optimizations should:

1. **Prevent Database Connection Exhaustion**: Reduced pool sizes and added connection testing
2. **Reduce Memory Usage**: Smaller cache sizes and batch sizes
3. **Improve Stability**: Circuit breakers and better error handling
4. **Better Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and monitoring
5. **Faster Recovery**: Shorter timeouts and failure detection

## Monitoring

The test now includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Pool utilization tracking
- Worker failure counting
- Operation timeout monitoring
- Resource cleanup verification
- CDC event processing metrics

## Usage

Run the optimized test with:

```bash
./run_optimized_test.sh
```

This will use all the conservative resource settings and provide detailed logging for monitoring resource consumption.
