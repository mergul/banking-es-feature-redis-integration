# Banking ES (Event Sourcing) Project

A sample banking application demonstrating Event Sourcing principles with Rust.

## Overview

This project implements basic banking functionalities such as account creation, deposits, and withdrawals using an event-sourced approach. It showcases how to build a system where all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events.

## Architecture & Services

The system is composed of several key parts:

*   **Domain Model:** Contains the core business logic and event definitions.
*   **Application Layer:** Orchestrates operations, handles commands, and uses services.
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** Manages data persistence (event store, projections) and external service integrations.
*   **Web API:** Exposes functionalities through an HTTP API (Axum).

### Key Dependencies & Services:

*   **PostgreSQL:** Used as the primary data store for events and projections.
*   **Redis:** Integrated for performance enhancement and specific functionalities:
    *   **Account Data Caching:** Acts as a read-through cache (L1 cache) for frequently accessed account data to reduce database load.
    *   **Event Batching:** Events are temporarily queued in Redis lists before being flushed to the PostgreSQL event store by a background worker. This can help in smoothing out write loads.
    *   **Command De-duplication:** Used to prevent processing of duplicate commands within a certain time window, ensuring idempotency for critical operations.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Rust toolchain (if building/running locally without Docker for the application)

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for local development)

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Ensure you have a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (if provided) or create one.
    *   The application requires `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL and `REDIS_URL` for Redis.
    *   Default for Docker Compose:
        *   `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/banking_es`
        *   `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379` (The `redis` hostname refers to the Redis service in `docker-compose.yml`)

2.  **Start Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the application container and start all necessary services, including PostgreSQL and Redis, as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3.  The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Local Development (without Docker for the application)

If you run the application directly using `cargo run`:

1.  Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis instances are running and accessible.
2.  Set the `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` environment variables to point to your instances. For example:
    ```bash
    export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname"
    export REDIS_URL="redis://your_redis_host:6379"
    cargo run
    ```

## API Endpoints

(Details about API endpoints would go here - e.g., create account, deposit, withdraw, get account)

## Rate Limiting and Request Validation

This system implements a robust rate limiting and request validation middleware to ensure secure and controlled access to the banking API endpoints.

### Rate Limiting

The rate limiting system provides per-client request throttling with the following features:

- **Per-Client Rate Limits**: Each client is limited to a configurable number of requests per minute
- **Burst Control**: Configurable burst size to handle sudden spikes in traffic
- **Sliding Window**: Rate limits are enforced using a sliding window approach
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired rate limits are automatically cleaned up

#### Configuration

Rate limits can be configured through the `RateLimitConfig` struct:

```rust
pub struct RateLimitConfig {
    pub requests_per_minute: u32,  // Default: 60
    pub burst_size: u32,          // Default: 10
    pub window_size: Duration,     // Default: 60 seconds
    pub max_clients: usize,        // Default: 10000
}
```

### Request Validation

The request validation system provides a flexible and extensible way to validate incoming requests:

- **Pluggable Validators**: Custom validation rules can be implemented for different request types
- **Detailed Validation Results**: Includes both errors and warnings
- **Type-Specific Validation**: Different validation rules for different endpoints
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new validation rules

#### Available Validators

1. **AccountCreationValidator**
   - Validates account creation requests
   - Checks for required fields: `owner_name`, `initial_balance`
   - Ensures `initial_balance` is non-negative
   - Validates `owner_name` is non-empty

2. **TransactionValidator**
   - Validates transaction requests (deposits and withdrawals)
   - Checks for required fields: `account_id`, `amount`
   - Validates `account_id` is a valid UUID
   - Ensures `amount` is greater than zero

### Usage

#### Client Requirements

Clients must include the following headers in their requests:

```http
x-client-id: <unique-client-identifier>
x-user-id: <optional-user-identifier>
```

#### Example Requests

1. **Create Account**
```http
POST /accounts
x-client-id: client123
x-user-id: user456
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "owner_name": "John Doe",
    "initial_balance": 1000.00
}
```

2. **Deposit Money**
```http
POST /accounts/{account_id}/deposit
x-client-id: client123
x-user-id: user456
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 500.00,
    "expected_version": 1
}
```

3. **Withdraw Money**
```http
POST /accounts/{account_id}/withdraw
x-client-id: client123
x-user-id: user456
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 200.00,
    "expected_version": 2
}
```

### Response Codes

The system returns the following HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Request processed successfully
- `201 Created`: Account created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request payload
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

### Error Responses

Rate limit and validation errors return detailed error messages:

```json
{
    "error": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

or

```json
{
    "error": "owner_name is required, initial_balance must be non-negative"
}
```

### Implementation Details

#### Rate Limiting Implementation

The rate limiter uses a combination of:
- DashMap for thread-safe storage of rate limit information
- Semaphores for burst control
- Sliding window algorithm for accurate rate limiting

#### Request Validation Implementation

The validation system uses:
- Trait-based design for extensibility
- Async validation support
- Detailed validation results with errors and warnings
- Type-safe validation rules

### Adding Custom Validators

To add a custom validator:

1. Implement the `RequestValidationRule` trait:
```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl RequestValidationRule for CustomValidator {
    async fn validate(&self, context: &RequestContext) -> ValidationResult {
        // Implement validation logic
    }
}
```

2. Register the validator:
```rust
middleware.register_validator(
    "custom_request_type".to_string(),
    Box::new(CustomValidator),
);
```

## System Review and Analysis

This section provides an analysis of the `banking-es` project, covering its architecture, reliability, performance, and recommendations for improvement, based on a detailed codebase review.

### Overall Summary

The `banking-es` project implements a banking application using an event-sourced architecture. It leverages Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), with Apache Kafka serving as an event bus for decoupling and asynchronous processing. PostgreSQL is used for the event store and read projections, while Redis provides multi-level caching and supports distributed operations like locking and rate limiting. The primary goal is to create a scalable, resilient, and maintainable banking system. The application is built in Rust using the Axum web framework and the Tokio asynchronous runtime.

### Reliability and Robustness

The system is designed with a strong focus on reliability and robustness, essential for a financial application.

*   **Strengths**:
    *   **Event Sourcing**: Provides an immutable audit log of all changes, facilitating debugging, state reconstruction, and temporal queries. This is a solid foundation for data integrity.
    *   **Kafka Integration**: Using Kafka as an event bus decouples components, provides message durability, and allows for resilient, asynchronous processing of events. This helps absorb load spikes and handle temporary unavailability of downstream services.
    *   **Fault Tolerance Patterns**:
        *   **Circuit Breaker & Load Shedding (Redis)**: The `RedisClientTrait` abstraction includes wrappers for circuit breaking and load shedding, making Redis interactions more resilient to failures or overload.
        *   **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for Kafka**: Failed messages during event processing can be routed to a DLQ, allowing for inspection, automated retries with backoff, and manual intervention if necessary.
        *   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: The codebase consistently uses `Result` types and custom error enums, promoting explicit error management.

*   **Areas for Improvement**:
    *   **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: While the design incorporates versioning for aggregates and events, the implementation of OCC checks within the `EventStore` during event persistence must be rigorously verified and tested to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency, especially given Kafka's at-least-once delivery.
    *   **Persistent User Store**: The `AuthService` currently uses an in-memory store for user credentials. This is not suitable for production and must be replaced with a persistent database solution for user data to be durable and consistent across application instances.
    *   **DLQ Management**: Ensure robust operational procedures for monitoring the DLQ, alerting on permanently failing messages, and re-processing or discarding them as appropriate.
    *   **L1 Cache Coherence**: The mechanism for updating/invalidating L1 in-memory caches across distributed instances (presumably via Kafka cache update topics) needs to be thoroughly implemented and tested to ensure data consistency.

### Performance

The architecture includes several features aimed at achieving high performance and scalability.

*   **Strengths**:
    *   **Asynchronous Processing**: Built entirely on Tokio and `async/await`, enabling high concurrency and efficient handling of I/O-bound operations (database, Kafka, Redis, network).
    *   **Multi-Level Caching**:
        *   **L1 In-Memory Cache**: Sharded `DashMap`s in `CacheService` provide extremely fast access to frequently used account data and events.
        *   **L2 Redis Cache**: A distributed Redis cache reduces load on the primary database for common queries and cached domain objects.
    *   **Database Optimization**:
        *   **Batching**: Event persistence to PostgreSQL and projection updates are batched, significantly improving write throughput.
        *   **Connection Pooling**: `sqlx::PgPool` is used for efficient database connection management.
    *   **Snapshotting**: The `EventStore` implements snapshotting for aggregates, which drastically reduces the time required to load aggregates with long event histories.
    *   **Scalability by Design**: The use of Kafka for event distribution and the provisions for sharding (`ShardManager`) and service scaling (`ScalingManager`) allow for horizontal scaling.

*   **Areas for Monitoring/Optimization**:
    *   **Kafka Consumer Lag**: This is a critical metric. If event consumers (`KafkaEventProcessor`) cannot keep up with the rate of event production, projection staleness will increase, and the system might fall behind.
    *   **Database Performance**:
        *   **Projections**: Queries against projection tables (especially those involving scans or complex joins) should be monitored and optimized with appropriate indexing as data volume grows.
        *   **Event Store Writes**: While batched, high contention on very active individual aggregates could lead to OCC failures or database hotspots.
    *   **Cache Performance**: Monitor hit/miss ratios for L1 and L2 caches. Tune cache sizes, TTLs, and eviction policies based on workload characteristics and available memory.
    *   **Serialization**: The system currently uses JSON for event data and Kafka messages. While convenient, at very high throughput, the CPU overhead of JSON serialization/deserialization could become a bottleneck. Consider evaluating binary formats (e.g., Protobuf, Avro) if this occurs.
    *   **Resource Usage**: Pay attention to the memory footprint of in-memory caches.

### Throughput Testing Advice

Thorough throughput testing is crucial to validate the system's performance characteristics and identify bottlenecks.

*   Utilize load testing tools like **k6**, Locust, or JMeter.
*   Employ monitoring tools such as **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization, and **Jaeger** for distributed tracing during tests.
*   Simulate **realistic workloads**, including a mix of command types (creations, deposits, withdrawals) and query patterns.
*   Test different components **end-to-end**, from API requests through the Kafka pipeline to database persistence and projection updates.
*   Monitor **key metrics**: Requests/Transactions Per Second (RPS/TPS), latency (average and percentiles), error rates, Kafka consumer lag, database query times, cache hit/miss ratios, and system resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O).

### Key Recommendations for Improvement

Addressing these points will further enhance the project's robustness, performance, and production readiness.

*   **Critical**:
    1.  **Verify and Rigorously Test Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: Ensure the `EventStore`'s mechanism for checking `expected_version` during event persistence is atomic and robust to prevent data inconsistencies.
    2.  **Implement a Persistent User Store**: Migrate `AuthService` user data from the current in-memory solution to a durable, persistent database.
    3.  **Ensure Robust L1 Cache Invalidation/Update Mechanisms**: Solidify and test the process for updating L1 in-memory caches across all distributed instances when underlying data changes (e.g., via Kafka cache events).

*   **Important**:
    1.  **Expand Test Coverage**: Increase the scope of unit, integration, and particularly end-to-end tests, focusing on failure scenarios and recovery paths.
    2.  **Kafka Consumer Performance**: Continuously monitor Kafka consumer lag. If it becomes a bottleneck, optimize consumer logic or scale consumer instances/partitions.
    3.  **Database Optimization**: Profile database queries, especially for read projections, and ensure appropriate indexing. Monitor write patterns to the event store.
    4.  **Cache Tuning**: Actively monitor and tune in-memory cache sizes (L1, snapshot cache) and eviction policies based on observed hit/miss rates and memory usage.

*   **Future Growth**:
    1.  **Serialization Format**: If JSON processing proves to be a significant performance bottleneck at scale, evaluate more efficient binary serialization formats (e.g., Protobuf, Avro) for Kafka messages and event data.
    2.  **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Develop, document, and regularly test comprehensive DR plans, including backup/restore of the PostgreSQL event store and procedures for rebuilding state (projections, caches).
    3.  **Enhanced Command Idempotency**: For operations where clients might retry after timeouts, consider implementing a more persistent command tracking mechanism if the current short-term de-duplication in `AccountService` is insufficient.
    4.  **Production-Grade Scaling**: Further develop the `ScalingManager` to integrate with a specific container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes HPA) for automated, production-ready scaling.
    5.  **Configuration Management**: Review and consolidate any redundant configuration structures (e.g., `AppConfig`, Kafka configurations) for clarity and easier management.

By focusing on these areas, the `banking-es` project can evolve into an exceptionally reliable and performant system.
