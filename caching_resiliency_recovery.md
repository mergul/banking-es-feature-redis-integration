# Caching, Resiliency, and Recovery Strategies

This document outlines the system's approach to distributed caching using Redis, and discusses patterns and mechanisms for ensuring resiliency and effective recovery.

## Distributed Caching with Redis

Distributed caching is employed to improve response times for frequently accessed data and to reduce load on backend services and databases. Redis is the chosen solution for this, as indicated by `src/infrastructure/redis_abstraction.rs` and `src/infrastructure/cache_service.rs`.

### Use Cases for Redis

1.  **Caching Read Models/Projections:**
    *   Frequently queried data from read models (which are themselves derived from events) can be cached in Redis. For example, user account balances, product information, or session data.
    *   This significantly speeds up query responses for common requests.
    *   The `src/infrastructure/l1_cache_updater.rs` might suggest a sophisticated caching strategy, possibly involving multiple cache layers or proactive cache updates.

2.  **Session Management:**
    *   If the web layer maintains user sessions, Redis provides a fast and scalable distributed session store.

3.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Redis is effective for implementing rate limiting logic (indicated by `src/infrastructure/rate_limiter.rs`) by tracking request counts per user or IP address over time windows.

4.  **Short-Lived Data:**
    *   Storing temporary data, flags, or locks.

### Cache Invalidation Strategies

Maintaining cache consistency with the source of truth (the event store and derived read models) is crucial. Common strategies include:
*   **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):** The application first checks Redis for data. If not found (cache miss), it fetches from the database, stores it in Redis, and then returns it.
*   **Write-Through:** Data is written to Redis and the database simultaneously (or Redis first). This keeps the cache more consistent but can add latency to writes.
*   **Event-Driven Updates:** Consumers of domain events (from Kafka) can proactively update or invalidate relevant cache entries in Redis when underlying data changes. This is often a good fit for CQRS/ES architectures. `src/infrastructure/l1_cache_updater.rs` might be involved in such a process.

The `cache_service.rs` likely abstracts these strategies and provides a unified interface for caching operations.

## Resiliency Patterns

Resiliency is the ability of the system to withstand and recover from failures. Several patterns and practices contribute to this:

1.  **Decoupling with Kafka:**
    *   Kafka itself acts as a shock absorber. If a downstream service (e.g., a projection updater) fails, events accumulate in Kafka topics, and the producer service is not directly impacted. The consumer can recover and process messages later.

2.  **Idempotent Consumers:**
    *   Kafka consumers should be designed to be idempotent. This means processing an event multiple times (due to retries or redeliveries) does not result in incorrect data or duplicate actions. This is vital for Kafka's at-least-once delivery guarantee.

3.  **Retries with Backoff:**
    *   For transient failures (e.g., temporary network issues), consumers and inter-service communication should implement retry mechanisms, often with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming a struggling service.

4.  **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs):**
    *   As implemented via `src/infrastructure/kafka_dlq.rs`, events that consistently fail processing by a consumer are moved to a DLQ for later inspection and handling. This prevents a single "poison pill" message from halting all further processing for that consumer group. These events can be analyzed and reprocessed later if necessary.

5.  **Timeouts:**
    *   Setting appropriate timeouts for external calls (database, other services, Kafka operations) prevents indefinite blocking and cascading failures.

6.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   `src/infrastructure/rate_limiter.rs` helps protect the system from being overwhelmed by too many requests from a single client or by denial-of-service attacks.

7.  **Bulkheads (Inferred):**
    *   While not explicitly visible, a microservices-oriented deployment or careful resource pooling can implement the bulkhead pattern, isolating failures in one part of the system from affecting others.

8.  **Rust's Error Handling:**
    *   Rust's `Result` and `Option` types enforce explicit error handling, reducing the likelihood of unhandled exceptions that can crash processes.

## Recovery Mechanisms

Recovery refers to how the system restores its state and functionality after a failure.

1.  **Replaying Events (from Kafka or Event Store):**
    *   **Read Models:** If a read model becomes corrupted or needs to be rebuilt (e.g., due to a bug in a projection), it can often be recreated by replaying events from the relevant Kafka topics or directly from the primary Event Store.
    *   **Kafka Consumer State:** Kafka consumers track their progress (offsets). If a consumer crashes, it can typically resume from its last known offset. `src/infrastructure/kafka_recovery.rs` and `src/infrastructure/kafka_recovery_strategies.rs` point to explicit mechanisms for managing this.

2.  **DLQ Reprocessing:**
    *   Events in a Dead Letter Queue can be examined. If the issue causing the failure is resolved, these events can be re-queued or processed by a specialized utility.

3.  **Database Backups and Restore:**
    *   Standard database backup procedures for PostgreSQL (both the event store and any SQL-based read models) are essential for disaster recovery.

4.  **Stateful Component Recovery:**
    *   Kafka and Redis themselves have their own persistence and clustering mechanisms to recover from node failures.

5.  **Application Restarts:**
    *   Stateless services can often be recovered simply by restarting them. For stateful services or those managing in-flight data (like Kafka consumers), graceful shutdown and proper offset management are key.

By combining these caching, resiliency, and recovery techniques, the system aims to be highly available, fault-tolerant, and capable of recovering from various failure scenarios.
